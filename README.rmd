<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository contains the code that will be used for the 2023 ICRW8 workshop (https://icrwatersheds.org/icrw8/icrw8-schedule/june-5-workshops/). This workshop involves retrieving data from the STEWARDS database (https://www.nrrig.mwa.ars.usda.gov/stewards/stewards.html) and NEON data portal (https://data.neonscience.org/). Participants will then use a combination of excel and R software to merge the datasets and compare water quality parameters at two nearby Georgia rivers, the Little River and Flint River. Spreadsheets and code used for the workshop will be available on GitHub for reference before and after the workshop.

<!-- ****** Organizers ****** -->

Organized by Oliva Pisani (USDA-ARS), Jim Coloso (NEON), Bobby Hensley (NEON), and Kaelin Cawley (NEON).

<!-- ****** Prep ****** -->
## Preparation for the workshop
1. Optional, but very helpful! Create an API token using the instructions in the following tutorial, which shouldn't take more than 10 minutes (https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/neon-api-tokens-tutorial)
2. Ensure that you have a recent R version installed on your computer. (Tutorial leaders will have version >= 4.2.0)
3. The tutorial leaders will use RStudio, which is also recommended, but optional.
4. Install required packages: `neonUtilities`, `plotly`, and `lubridate`. You can run the following to install all the packages: install.packages(c('neonUtilities','plotly','lubridate'))
